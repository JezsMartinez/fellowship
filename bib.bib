In this article, we review the recent progress in the development of analytical potential energy functions that aim at correctly representing many-body effects. Starting from the many-body expansion of the interaction energy, specific focus is on different classes of potential energy functions built upon a hierarchy of approximations and on their ability to accurately reproduce reference data obtained from state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations and experimental measurements. We show that most recent potential energy functions, which include explicit short-range representations of two-body and three-body effects along with a physically correct description of many-body effects at all distances, predict the properties of water from the gas to the condensed phase with unprecedented accuracy, thus opening the door to the long-sought “universal model” capable of describing the behavior of water under different conditions and in different environments.},

	abstract = {Obtaining a precise theoretical description of the spectral properties of liquid water poses challenges for both molecular dynamics (MD) and electronic structure methods. The lower computational cost of the Koopmans-compliant functionals with respect to Green’s function methods allows the simulations of many MD trajectories, with a description close to the state-of-art quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections method (QSGW + f xc). Thus, we explore water spectral properties when different MD approaches are used, ranging from classical MD to first-principles MD, and including nuclear quantum effects. We have observed that different MD approaches lead to up to 1 eV change in the average band gap; thus, we focused on the band gap dependence with the geometrical properties of a system to explain such spread. We have evaluated the changes in the band gap due to variations in the intramolecular O–H bond distance and HOH angle, as well as the intermolecular hydrogen bond O···O distance and the OHO angles. We have observed that the dominant contribution comes from the O–H bond length; the O···O distance plays a secondary role, and the other geometrical properties do not significantly influence the gap. Furthermore, we analyze the electronic density of states (DOS), where the KIPZ functional shows good agreement with the DOS obtained with state-of-art approaches employing quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections. The O–H bond length also significantly influences the DOS. When nuclear quantum effects are considered, broadening of the peaks driven by the broader distribution of the O–H bond lengths is observed, leading to a closer agreement with the experimental photoemission spectra.

	abstract = {Computational modeling at the atomistic and mesoscopic levels has undergone dramatic development in the past 10 years to meet the challenge of adequately accounting for the many-body nature of intermolecular interactions. At the heart of this challenge is the ability to identify the strengths and specific limitations of pairwise-additive interactions, to improve classical models to explicitly account for many-body effects, and consequently to enhance their ability to describe a wider range of reference data and build confidence in their predictive capacity. However, the corresponding computational cost of these advanced classical models increases significantly enough that statistical convergence of condensed phase observables becomes more difficult to achieve. Here we review a hierarchy of potential energy surface models used in molecular simulations for systems with many degrees of freedom that best meet the trade-off between accuracy and computational speed in order to define a sweet spot for a given scientific problem of interest.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present the main features and algorithmic details of a novel implementation of the frozen density embedding (FDE) formulation of subsystem density functional theory (DFT) that is specifically designed to enable ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of large‐scale condensed‐phase systems containing 1000s of atoms. This code (available at http://eqe.rutgers.edu) has been given the moniker of embedded Quantum ESPRESSO (eQE) as it is a generalization of the open‐source Quantum ESPRESSO (QE) suite of programs. The strengths of eQE reside in a hierarchical parallelization scheme that allows for an efficient and fully self‐consistent treatment of the electronic structure (via the addition of an additional DIIS extrapolation layer) while simultaneously exploiting the inherent symmetries and periodicities in the system (via sampling of subsystem‐specific first Brillouin zones and utilization of subsystem‐specific basis sets). While bulk liquids and molecular crystals are two classes of systems that exemplify the utility of the FDE approach (as these systems can be partitioned into weakly interacting subunits), we show that eQE has significantly extended this regime of applicability by outperforming standard semilocal Kohn–Sham DFT (KS‐DFT) for large‐scale heterogeneous catalysts with quite different layer‐specific electronic structure and intrinsic periodicities. eQE features very favorable strong parallel scaling for a model system of bulk liquid water composed of 256 water molecules, which allows for a significant decrease in the overall time to solution when compared to KS‐DFT. We show that eQE achieves speedups greater than one order of magnitude ( >10×) when performing AIMD simulations of such large‐scale condensed‐phase systems as: (1) molecular liquids via bulk liquid water represented by 1024 independent water molecules (3072 atoms with a 25.3× speedup over KS‐DFT), (2) polypeptide/biomolecule solvation via (gly)6 solvated in (H2O)395 (1230 atoms with a 38.6× speedup over KS‐DFT), and (3) molecular crystals via a 3 × 3 × 3 periodic supercell of pentacene (1940 atoms with a 12.0× speedup over KS‐DFT). These results represent a significant improvement over the current state‐of‐the‐art and now enable subsystem DFT‐based AIMD simulations of realistically sized condensed‐phase systems of interest throughout chemistry, physics, and materials science.

	abstract = {Molecular simulations are powerful tools for providing atomic-level details into complex chemical and physical processes that occur in the condensed phase. For strongly interacting systems where quantum many-body effects are known to play an important role, density-functional methods are often used to provide the model with the potential energy used to drive dynamics. These methods, however, suffer from two major drawbacks. First, they are often too computationally intensive to practically apply to large systems over long time scales, limiting their scope of application. Second, there remain challenges for these models to obtain the necessary level of accuracy for weak non-bonded interactions to obtain quantitative accuracy for a wide range of condensed phase properties. Quantum mechanical force fields (QMFFs) provide a potential solution to both of these limitations. In this review, we address recent advances in the development of QMFFs for condensed phase simulations. In particular, we examine the development of QMFF models using both approximate and ab initio density-functional models, the treatment of short-ranged non-bonded and long-ranged electrostatic interactions, and stability issues in molecular dynamics calculations. Example calculations are provided for crystalline systems, liquid water, and ionic liquids. We conclude with a perspective for emerging challenges and future research directions.},

	abstract = {CONSPECTUS: The structures and spectroscopic properties of molecules and condensed-phase systems are usually experimentally characterized by X-ray, infrared (IR), Raman, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and electronic absorption/emission spectra. Quantum mechanics (QM) calculations are critical in quantitatively understanding the relationship between the structure and physicochemical properties of various chemical systems. However, it is very challenging to apply traditional QM methods to large molecules and condensed-phase systems with large unit cells due to their steep computational scaling with the system size. To overcome this difficulty, theoretical chemists have developed various linear (or low) scaling QM methods, among which energy-based fragmentation methods have achieved great success for large molecules or clusters. One of the most popular energy-based fragmentation methods is the generalized energy-based fragmentation (GEBF) approach developed by us. In this approach, the ground-state energy of a large molecule can be evaluated from the ground-state energies of a series of embedded subsystems. In this Account, we focus on the recent developments and applicability of the GEBF approach for the structures and spectroscopic properties of complicated large molecules and condensed-phase systems. With new fragmentation schemes, the GEBF approach can now describe ionic liquid clusters and metal-containing supramolecular systems accurately and can provide accurate binding energies for host-guest complexes. In addition, the GEBF approach is now available for describing the localized excited states of large systems including a chromophore. More importantly, the GEBF approach under periodic boundary conditions (PBC-GEBF) has been developed to deal with periodic molecular crystals and liquids. Then, the ground-state energy (or property) per unit cell of a periodic condensed phase system can be predicted with QM calculations on nonperiodic embedded subsystems. This feature enables accurate electron correlation calculations on molecular crystals and liquids to be feasible on ordinary workstations. The PBC-GEBF approach has been applied to predict the crystal structures, lattice energies, and spectroscopic properties of some typical molecular crystals and solutions. By combining the GEBF method and machine learning (ML) method, a GEBF-ML force field has been developed for long normal alkanes, and the IR spectra of long alkanes can be obtained from the GEBF-ML molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The GEBF and its periodic variant are expected to play increasingly important roles in investigating real-life chemical systems of broad interests at the ab initio levels.},
